    There are three types of element in an html:--
        1. Inline Element: These element aquires only the required amount of horizontal or vertical space in page
                           These elements allows others to sit next to its side
                           We cann not change width of these elements
                           eg- <span>, <a>, <img>
        
        2. Block Elements: These elements aquires the whole space in horizontal line in a page and do not allow any
                           other element to sit on its next side.
                           We can change width of such elements
                           eg- <p>, <h1> etc.
        
        3. Inline-Block Element: These elements act as both, inline and block elements. eg- <img>
                                 We can change their width and they allows other elements to sit on its next side as well
                                               
    Display:-
    Through CSS we can change the property of an element to inline, block or inline-block as follows:-

        1. Display: inline; This allows us to convert any element into inline element thus allowing us to put any other 
                            element next to its side.

        2. Display: block;  This allows us to convert any element into block element thus blocking the entire horizontal
                            rule.
            
        3. Display: inline-block; This allows us to use any element with the property of both inline as well ass block.
     
    Some Other HTML/CSS elements:-
        1. Visibility-  Through this property we can hide or unhide any parapgraph or particular word. This is helpful in
                        creating quiz.
                        In this property we only hide the word but it will still be there on the page and it will occupy
                        space in the page.
        
        2. Display: none; Through this property we can delete any para or word as if it was never in the page before.
